<p>
	Hey there, I'm your friendly neighborhood twenty-something explorer, rocking the role of a DevOps
	Engineer extraordinaire in the mysterious realm of ID.
</p>
<br />

<p>
	Before I embarked on this epic DevOps journey, I had my fair share of adventures as the Network
	Ninja at the University Software Laboratory. 🚀💻🌟

<h2>The Gears?</h2>
<p>
	Uh-oh, I'm in deep trouble here! 🙈 I've got a collection of these things, and they all seem to
	have a mind of their own! I swear, they're all different and unique, each with its own special
	purpose... or so I tell myself!
</p>
<br />

<h2>The Computers?</h2>
<br />

<p>
	Oh, they're my digital buddies, my silicon soulmates! 🖥️🤖 I've got this thing for Linux and Open
	Source that's as strong as a titanium-plated keyboard
